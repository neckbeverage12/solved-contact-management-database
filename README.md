Launched in 2005 in Boston, Massachusetts, Academic Software has consistently been the

to academic customers, offering thousands of full-version software titles at great discounts.

Academic Software has partnered with the top technology manufacturers, including Adobe, Microsoft, Sibelius, Sony Media Software, and Wacom, to offer excellent service and

prices, which are available only to students, schools, and teachers.

From the very beginning, Academic Software has relied heavily on technology to ensure

a positive shopping experience for its customers. The company’s philosophy is simple: Hire

amazing people, give them the best tools, and help them deliver an unbeatable customer

experience.
